## Regression

**Regression analysis** is one of the most important fields in _statistics_ and machine learning. There are many _regression methods_ available. _Linear regression_ is one of them.


## Why Regression ?

#### <span style="color:blue">Regression searches for relationships among variables</font>.

For example, you can observe several employees of some company and try to understand how their salaries depend on the features, such as experience, level of education, role, city they work in, and so on.

This is a regression problem where data related to each employee represent one observation. The presumption is that the experience, education, role, and city are the independent features, while the salary depends on them.

Similarly, you can try to establish a mathematical dependence of the prices of houses on their areas, numbers of bedrooms, distances to the city center, and so on.

Generally, in regression analysis, you usually consider some phenomenon of interest and have a number of observations. Each observation has two or more features. Following the assumption that (at least) one of the features depends on the others, you try to establish a relation among them.

In other words, you need to find a **function that maps some features or variables to others sufficiently well**.

The dependent features are called the **dependent variables**, **outputs**, or **responses**.

The independent features are called the **independent variables**, **inputs**, or **predictors**.

**Regression problems usually have one continuous and unbounded dependent variable. The inputs, however, can be continuous, discrete, or even categorical data such as gender, nationality, brand, and so on**.

It is a common practice to denote the outputs with 𝑦 and inputs with 𝑥. If there are two or more independent variables, they can be represented as the vector **𝐱 = (𝑥₁, …, 𝑥ᵣ)**, where **𝑟** is the number of inputs.

## When Do You Need Regression?
Typically, you need regression to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related. For example, you can use it to determine if and to what extent the experience or gender impact salaries.

Regression is also useful when you want to forecast a response using a new set of predictors. For example, you could try to predict electricity consumption of a household for the next hour given the outdoor temperature, time of day, and number of residents in that household.

**Regression** is used in many different fields: **economy**, computer science, social sciences, and so on. Its importance rises every day with the availability of large amounts of data and increased awareness of the practical value of data.
