This equation is the regression equation. **𝛽₀, 𝛽₁, …, 𝛽ᵣ** are the regression coefficients, and 𝜀 is the random error.\n",

They define the estimated regression function **𝑓(𝐱) = 𝑏₀ + 𝑏₁𝑥₁ + ⋯ + 𝑏ᵣ𝑥**ᵣ. This function should capture the dependencies between the inputs and output sufficiently well.\n",

        "The estimated or predicted response, **𝑓(𝐱ᵢ)**, for each observation **𝑖 = 1, …, 𝑛**, should be as close as possible to the corresponding actual response 𝑦ᵢ. The differences **𝑦ᵢ - 𝑓(𝐱ᵢ)** for all observations **𝑖 = 1, …, 𝑛,** are called the residuals. Regression is about determining the best predicted weights, that is the weights corresponding to the smallest residuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "To get the best weights, you usually minimize the sum of squared residuals (SSR) for all observations **𝑖 = 1, …, 𝑛: SSR = Σᵢ(𝑦ᵢ - 𝑓(𝐱ᵢ))²**. This approach is called the method of ordinary least squares."

        "The coefficient of determination, denoted as **𝑅²**, tells you which amount of variation in 𝑦 can be explained by the dependence on 𝐱 using the particular regression model.

For example, the leftmost observation (green circle) has the input 𝑥 = 5 and the actual output (response) 𝑦 = 5. The next one has 𝑥 = 15 and 𝑦 = 20, and so on.\n",

Your goal is to calculate the optimal values of the predicted weights 𝑏₀ and 𝑏₁ that minimize SSR and determine the estimated regression function. The value of 𝑏₀, also called the intercept, shows the point where the estimated regression line crosses the 𝑦 axis. It is the value of the estimated response 𝑓(𝑥) for 𝑥 = 0. The value of 𝑏₁ determines the slope of the estimated regression line.\n",
